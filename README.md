# Bio 
I'm Kori and my aim is to work on important things that otherwise would not be built. 

Previously, I was a Founder-in-Residence at Entrepreneur First, and before that I co-founded a startup that raised $8.3M and sent a human to space via Blue Origin.

I completed a BA & MEng Engineering Science at Oxford University with a focus on Clinical AI, where I built models that served as 'AI-powered Clinical Alarms' to predict if patients would be admitted to ICUs. I also worked on fun projects like designing a cooling system for a heat stage within a scanning electron microscope.

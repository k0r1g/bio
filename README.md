# Bio 
I'm Kori and my aim is to pursue important & uncharted quests.

Previously, I was a Founder-in-Residence at Entrepreneur First, and before that I co-founded a startup that raised $8.3M and sent a human to space via Blue Origin.

I completed a BA & MEng in Engineering Science at Oxford University with a focus on Clinical AI, where I built models that enable clinical alarms to predict if patients would be admitted to ICUs before a medical emergency occurs.

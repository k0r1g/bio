Probably a good time for an update. I'm in London, I have a few days at the Highton's Ealing house, where I am staying till Sunday. On Wednesday, I'm planning to move into a hack house for 2 weeks. Need to figure out arrangements for the days piror to that and obviously alternative arrangements if the hack house doesn't work out. I will sort all of this out today. 

The goal today is to actually get 1 solid pomodoro on CodeSignal stuff. I am just going to fully prioritize the github page on CodeSignal questions for this pomodoro. The second goal is to come up with 3 good startup ideas.

**AutoRAND.** 

This will be a startup but also a think tank. Inspired by the RAND corporation. Why? I think the world is going to change. I'm worried. I think AGI is going to change everything- labour markets, geo-politics, religion, etc. and the world will be tumultuous. 

We need scientists and economists to work on the hard sciences. We will hire the best emerging talent in the hard sciences. I think we need to work with Nation States on proejcts of national interest but around the sciences. 

But we must work on the applied sciences before working on basic science. 

By the way RAND started with a $10M seed.




















- Eventually I want to build space mega-structures. (Start with autonomy, move to hardware)

AGI is not sufficient to automate R&D. 

We need an Andruil-like system that connects with sensors and automatically enables real-time decisions. Focus on experiments that are longer-scale- that requires a scientists supervision to do stuff- e.g. imagine an expetiment that requires monitoring something, then releasing a gas, then monitoring the results, then repeating- we have the model do this. 




Ok onto the main stuff:

N.B. These essays will be rambly in nature, and I have no expectation for anyone to read them. If you do read them, thank you! 

This October, I'm going to take on a series of challenges. I will lay out these challenges in advance, and if I don't do them, I will run 5 kilometers the next day- with a failure post explaining why I failed.  

The main challenge is to write a mini-blog post every day- the only requirement is that I spend at minimum 15 minutes writing each post, for now I will aim to do this for 2 consecutive weeks. 

The second challenge is to push code to Github every day, again for 2 weeks.

The tertiary challenge is to do anki daily, again for 2 weeks. 

Over the course of this month, I expect to challenge myself in a variety of time-bound ways, for example, I could do a juice fast for 3 days, or I could try working on a standing desk for a week. Both the challenges and the blog posts are a part of a larger experiment to be open about my goals and progress. Here's me being open:

For example, I will put it out there right now that I am currently going through an interview process with Scale AI that I am hoping to get. I am also applying to the MATS program, because I am deeply interested in mechanistic interpretability- and more importantly, I'd like to leverage my mathematically-inclined background and work in an area that requires that skillset. 

I want to move to SF. I want to move to SF. I want to move to SF. 

I am working with a PhD friend from Oxford and we've been hacking projects together- like a GenAI wrapper that answers all the homework questions on a website. I like it, I want to do more of it, and I want to ramp up the scale of these projects. 

I am deeply AGI-pilled. I remember in 2021, I was working on applying LSTMs (and simpler models like SVMs) on time-series clinical data to predict clinical emergenices, having conversations with friends about how unlikely AGI was, and suddenly we passed the Turing test in 2022. It's 2024, and I feel AGI is coming. The priveleged few working on it may be the main characters, leaving the rest of us as NPCs. As someone not working in a frontier AI lab, I must strategise deeply on how to do meaningful work in this paradigm- at least that's my belief. It's kind of a weird situation that's made me feel nihilist in a way that I haven't since my early teens. Expanding the limits of technology via a startup has always been my framing for how to meaningfully contribute to this world, and with AGI around the corner, I feel a need to adapt- not on building a startup, but around what kind of startups even make sense. Anyway- more on this in a future post. 

The larger goal is to build a meaningful AGI-proof startup & hack on really interesting problems, and go autistically deep in areas that I find exciting. 

Some to dos regarding this challenge: 
- Refactor this blog site
- Write a post on my process of applying to MATS
- Write a post on my process of interviewing with Scale AI
- Write a post about ClickSolve AI
- BIG POST: Building a startup in a post-AGI world. 
- Once I move to SF, I wish to write a blog post about the multi-year journey it took me to get there.

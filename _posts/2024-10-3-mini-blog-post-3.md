I'm in London! It's Thursdsay, and the Mistral Hackathon is over the weekend, so I need to do quite a bit of stuff over the next couple days, because my weekend will be blocked off. 

My running set of urgent to-do's:
- Apply to MATS (and write the LessWrong post, and email Nina)
- Apply to Z-Fellows
- Get an Airbnb for my time in London (figure out how long I'll be here)
- Get a flight to SF (and book accomodation for my time there)
- Apply for a programme like 'The Residency' so I have a place to stay in SF
- Apply to a bunch of YC companies, AI Grant companies, Krea AI etc. Big Tech. Anything to get me into the door in the US. 
- Process my ESTA 

I'll start by booking an Airbnb from Friday-Tuesday, and then I'll figure out the rest of the logistics from there. Flight prices hover in the Â£400s for October, and drop in November. There's also the ESTA to consider, which is easy to get, but I've already stayed 3 months in SF this year, so I might deal with some trouble at the border. 

Booked the Airbnb- it wasn't cheap, and flights won't be cheap, and accomodation in SF won't be cheap. Slightly stressful, and I need to aggressively find ways to make money ASAP. Current plan, book a flight for next Wednesday. 

Spending some time with Grandma, so I'll have to step away. I'll come back to this blog and work after.

Hackathon is over. Now, it's time to get back to the real world and find some opportunities. 

My goal is for this blog post to continue to evolve into a larger essay around my journey applying for jobs and my journey to break into SF. 

First, I need to enter monk-mode. This means locking myself away and no distractions. I plan to be in this state for the rest of October at minimum. 

I simply need to figure out my visa pathway to the US. In complete detail. Below I will write out the visa pathway that I intend to take, step by step including the consultants that I will want to use and so on. This will lay out some more details, about where I want to be in the next few months. 
- details include things like applying to remote jobs in the US, not in-person ones, just to give myself a fighting chance. 
- or like applying for the B1, going to the US with the ESTA, while I wait for the results of the B1. 
- who are the top consultants that I can use? 
- if I do go to the US, what is my plan there? Where will I stay? What benefit do I get from being there vs anywhere else? Be very specific about your goals and what you want to achieve. 

I will also then write out a plan for how to do better in jobs. 
- For example, the tools I want to use for mass-applying for jobs. 
- How to be more granualar about my to-do's when it comes to job applications (and how i want to fill in my calendar to enable me to structure my work in a way that I dont miss anything)
- Things like applying to every YC/AI grant company that makes sense. 11x AI.
- Things about the career arc I wish to take and the skills I wish to develop. 

I think its clear that it will also be worth applying to graduate opportunities- genuinely look at Masters programs and PhD programs. Apply anyway. 
- Come up with the top ones, create a list. Get the transcripts. Apply. 

More immediately urgent than pretty much anything else is to figure out where i need to stay for the next 2 weeks. Rasched has kindly offered to host me, but I need to figure out if that makes sense for my personal goals. I can't just take the first most convenient opportunity that comes my way, I need to be strategic and think through my options. 

I think right now, I need to be an execution machine. I dont know if this is reflective of some kind of weakness in my psychology, but I want to force monk-mode somehow. For example, is it worth running a few experiments like: 
- Running every day for the next week. 
- Waking up at 5.30am every day for the next week, thus sleeping at 9.30pm every night. 

Yes, I want to try that. As a quick retrospective on the first 8 days of blogging, I will say that the one thing I have largely been consistent with is blogging. As for coding- I've kind of cheated, because while I have been pushing on github daily, it's largely these blog posts. I will say though that I've been coding way more than I have since basically my MEng. I've also not hit my anki goals. I will also come forth and admit that I have not been doing my punishments for missed daily tasks. I will improve. 

Despite all this, I feel the need to add more challenges. Monk-mode. Execution machine. 


**Today's Plan: Plan the next 2 weeks.**
Now-5.40pm: Eat, have a run, shower, shave, change. Done. 

My highlight of today will be to plan my next period, book my flights, book consultants etc. Essentially, place myself in a position to win. If I do that, then I have won the day, and set myself up for a successful end of week.

5.40pm: Go to the Hoxton. Plan out the next 2 weeks. Basically, Singapore could have been an option, but I think I will stay in the UK. My alternative thought was to go to the US straight away, but 2 weeks while I situate myself make sense. The most stressful part about my current situation is that I continue to stay in places for only a few days at a time. Book a location for the next 2 weeks. 

Tomorrow morning: I either go to the Hightons to do my laundry, or check-in to wherever I need to stay next. 

Reality check: expect the job search to take 3 months. In practice, this means I should expect to require accomodation for at minimum 3 months during this limbo period. 

Side note: You must really begin to do customer dev for your projects. Don't just build.

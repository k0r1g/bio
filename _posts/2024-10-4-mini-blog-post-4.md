I had some terrible sleep last night, I woke up at 3am and couldn't fall back asleep, I managed to catch a couple hours in the morning though. Doesn't matter- T-minus 1 day to the Mistral Hackathon. 

Yesterday, I got the confirmation that I will be teaming up with 2 other engineers, one of which is bringing a 3D printer, and we'll be working on a project that involves taking photos of one's mouth, and generating a 3D-printed mouth-guard. Sounds like fun- I suspect it won't be a project that will extend beyond the hackathon, but I'm really doing this all for the experience. 

Ok, so today, I've got to finish up some loose ends. I must apply to MATS. This is the number one priority. I'll do that immediately after this blog post. 

I've chosen not to immediately book a flight to SF to attempt to enter the country on an ESTA. Instead, I will do some further research on the B1, and see if I can leverage a Singaporean company I am a part-owner of to get the visa, which will allow me to stay in the US for 6 months. Dealing with the SF bits comes after the hackathon, including packing winter clothes and finding accomodation. It may well be that the ESTA is the way to go, but I'm going to explore all options. 

Note: ChatGPT Canvas is out. Worth exploring at some point. 
Note: Apply to Cambridge residency programme. 

I've received a couple stinging rejections from other applications I have made at the CV-screening stage. I must double down, and massively increase the amount of applications I must make. Keep pushing much harder, your success is a function of how much pain you can endure. 

Submitted the MATS application- might not be the best application, but it's done. If I must, I will try again in the future, when I've done more independent alignment research. Below was an answer to one question: 

*What kinds of projects are you most interested in working on during MATS?*
I am generally interested in understanding how post-training a model to reason with CoT impacts model representation. I think its possibly interesting to assume that CoT is faithful to cognition and use outputted CoT as explanations for how well a circuit discovered by SAEs matches the input-ouput behaviour. Can we connect the circuit to specific parts of the CoT by extending Leo Gao's work on Shapley Value Attribution in CoT? Is this a decent base for defining a language for explaining circuits?

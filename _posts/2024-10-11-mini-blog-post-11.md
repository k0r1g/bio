Probably a good time for an update. I'm in London, I have a few days at the Highton's Ealing house, where I am staying till Sunday. On Wednesday, I'm planning to move into a hack house for 2 weeks. Need to figure out arrangements for the days piror to that and obviously alternative arrangements if the hack house doesn't work out. I will sort all of this out today. 

The goal today is to actually get 1 solid pomodoro on CodeSignal stuff. I am just going to fully prioritize the github page on CodeSignal questions for this pomodoro. The second goal is to come up with 3 good startup ideas.



Ok onto the main stuff:

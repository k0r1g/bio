It's the first of October! My Dad off-handedly remarked that Elon Musk is more productive than my brother and I combined. Ok, let's try to prove him wrong. 

Today, I have an interview with the Director of Engineering at Scale AI. I've only worked at startups that I've founded so this is a new experience. I should note, this is all part of a larger strategy to work on my ikigai, move to SF in order to increase my surface area of luck, and to build something amazing. 

In this essay, I'll lay out my plan for the day and my preparation. Back when I studied for exams, I used to say the real exam is in my preparation because that's when my score is baked in, actually sitting the test is a formality. Same principle applies here. 

Step 1: Generate a list of possible interview questions. 
Step 2: Write down 3-5 stories that are broad enough to answer all questions. Distill using the STAR method. 
Step 3: Practice. 

Not much to it, I'll be done in 1 hour. 

Other updates: 
- worked on refactoring this website, it's more modular now, but I've got this annoying bug in my css, so styling is completely off. I'll fix it tomorrow. 
- I'll have to plan my preparation for MATS, part of which involves writing a blog on LessWrong, so I'll have to come up with a topic. One idea is to riff on the Anthropic Interpretability updates, another is to think about interpretability in the context of chain-of-thought/reasoning models, which could be an interesting direction to go down. 
- I am confirmed to be going to the Mistral Hackathon this weekend, and I'll be hacking with Rasched on a chain-of-thought project, likely on the topic of exploring scientific hypotheses, no clear way to productise this though. 

Sidenote: be more aggressive. 

P.S. I am being way more open about my personal thoughts than I am comfortable with, but I think it's good to be more authentic, and it helps that no one actually reads this. 

P.P.S. I know I've got my Anki to do, but I actually enjoy doing that, and I'll get to it later on a break.

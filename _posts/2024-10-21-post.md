AI Scientist
- swe performance was at 18% dont be daunted by the 5% performance on sci code 
- they use aider for code- not just baseline model (look into why, maybe its an agent framework)
- since they focus on ml research, they are able to give a model a code template (specifically on ai training) for the model to start from 

wow! sakana ai paper has many interesting ideas:
* they give their ai scientist a code template (which contains plotting code, code on research topic, and some styling info) for the model to riff on

Not a productive day. 

Rasched and I commited to applying to YC in 1 month (Nov 12 deadline), ideally with a third co-founder. 

This means working very hard and very quickly to find an idea an build an MVP. We decided to apply some constraints to our process in order to speed work- first, with respect to product development, 80% trust our gut & 20% customer development (this flips after the MVP, but we won't get there before the YC application). Python-based projects only. Probably AI for Science.

We gave ourselves till Sunday to select our idea and to come up with three ideas a day, I came up short today.

Retrospectively written on Monday 7th October 2024. 

Day 1 was a good experience. We found out the night prior that the hackathon was capping team sizes to a maximum of 3 people, so Rasched and I had to part ways with the two guys working on the 3D printer. 

We quickly scoped out an idea for a game that involved a human playing against an AI at a 'Wiki Game', where you try to get from a starting Wikipedia article to a target Wikipedia article by only clicking the hyper-links contained within a page, with the human playing against the AI. 

We pretty much completed most of the game by the end of Day 1- in retrospect, we could have scoped out a little more of an ambitious project but I'm quite happy with what we ended up with.

Hackathon is over. Now, it's time to get back to the real world, and find some opportunities. 

My goal is for this blog post to continue to evolve into a larger essay around my journey applying for jobs and my journey to break into SF. 

First, I need to enter monk-mode. This means locking myself away and no distractions. I plan to be in this state for the rest of October at minimum. 

I simply need to figure out my visa pathway to the US. In complete detail. Below I will write out the visa pathway that I intend to take, step by step including the consultants that I will want to use and so on. This will lay out some more details, about where I want to be in the next few months. 
- details include things like applying to remote jobs in the US, not in-person ones, just to give myself a fighting chance. 
- or like applying for the B1, going to the US with the ESTA, while I wait for the results of the B1. 
- who are the top consultants that I can use? 
- if I do go to the US, what is my plan there? Where will I stay? What benefit do I get from being there vs anywhere else? Be very specific about your goals and what you want to achieve. 

I will also then write out a plan for how to do better in jobs. 
- For example, the tools I want to use for mass-applying for jobs. 
- How to be more granualar about my to-do's when it comes to job applications (and how i want to fill in my calendar to enable me to structure my work in a way that I dont miss anything)

I think its clear that it will also be worth applying to graduate opportunities- genuinely look at Masters programs and PhD programs. Apply anyway. 
- Come up with the top ones, create a list. Get the transcripts. Apply. 

More immediately urgent than pretty much anything else is to figure out where i need to stay for the next 2 weeks. Rasched has kindly offered to host me, but I need to figure out if that makes sense for my personal goals. I can't just take the first most convenient opportunity that comes my way, I need to be strategic and think through my options. 

I think right now, you need to be an execution machine. I dont know if this is reflective of some kind of weakness in my psychology, but I want to force monk-mode somehow. For example, is it worth running a few experiments like: 
- Running every day for the next week. 
- Waking up at 5.30am every day for the next week, thus sleeping at 9.30pm every night. 

Yes, I want to try that. As a quick retrospective on the first 8 days of blogging, I will say that the one thing I have largely been consistent with is blogging. I've kind of cheated, because while I have been pushing on github daily, it's largely these blog posts. I will say though that I've been coding way more than I have, since basically my MEng. I've also not hit my anki goals. I will also come forth and admit that I have not been doing my punishments. 

Yet, I feel the need to add more challenges. Monk-mode. Execution machine.

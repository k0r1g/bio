**The design**   
Ok, so I forked bolt.new in order to make the front end for AutoRAND. A couple notable points to make here: first, that I'm quite impressed by StackBlitzâ€™s WebContainers, it basically allows you to embed an IDE (including filesystem, terminal & ability to install dependencies) into a website; second, that though forking bolt makes our product look like a co-pilot for now, it's fine as an MVP and I think the end-goal for it looks closer to a code editor. 

This is a 1 month sprint, but I've maybe gotten to 80% of what the front-end will be in basically half a day- thank you bolt & open-source!

**An AI-reasoning product, not an AI product**  
We're focussed on making this an o1 product vs a GPT product, meaning roughly that we trade-off cost & speed for extremely high reasoning. The reason why we've done this is science is a particularly reasoning-heavy field. What this means in the UX is that we'd like our user's queries to be as well-specified as possible, making the input bar closer to a word editor than a search bar. We instruct users: "Think of AutoRAND as a really smart friend you're going to send a DM to solve a problem. Plan your prompt & specify well." 

The first query will likely answered by o1, and follow-up queries by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. 

**The core technical challenge**  
*Starting from a very low bar*  
So, the core technical challenge of our sprint is to get our science code generation to a place where it beats benchmarks in a notably meaningful way- Claude 3.5 Sonnet currently scores 4.6%.

Here I list some of our hypotheses on how to meaningfully improve this score, roughly in descending order of my guess on how impactful I think they'll be. 

(0) An algorithmic solution that takes inspiration from [DeepMind's FunSearch](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/) or [Sakana's AI Scientist](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/). 

(1) Really good RAG to use scientific tools, packages, and functions. 
- Basically, this models off of MATLAB's toolboxes & in-built functions. Can we give our model toolboxes & in-built functions to solve computational problems rather than asking it to re-invent the wheel?

- As an example, defaulting to Convex Optimization solvers like [CVXGEN](CVXGEN) exist and are said to be used in SpaceX rockets- the model should want to use these function rather than build something from scratch. 

- Check out [MATLAB's documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/index.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav) there is something to be learned here.

(2) Really good RAG to encourage adding adding scientific context to queries. 
- An obvious point, but this is promising because SciCode showed that adding scientific context to queries improvred results significantly.

(4) Tricks? Does getting the model to code in MATLAB then convert that to Python help?


**Defining our problem-choice**  
*Fields & Sub-fields*  
SciCode has listed 5 fields (Math, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Material Science) and 16 sub-fields (Condensed Matter Physics, Quantum Chemistry, Semiconductor Materials etc.). 

*Problem structuring*  
SciCode roughly categorises problems into main-problems and sub-problems, where sub-problems have dependencies on each other, and must collectively be solved in order to solve the main-problem. The logic in mapping this out is itself a fascinating challenge, but not where we are starting with.  

*Categories of computational scientific work*  
So SciCode defines three meta-categories of computational scientific work:(1) numerical methods, (2) simulation of systems, (3) scientific calculations.

For example, a climate scientist might use numerical methods to solve differential equations (category 1), create a simulation of global weather patterns (category 2), and then perform statistical analyses and create visualizations of the results (category 3).

We will work on scientific calculations & on sub-problems that are as close to biophysics as possible. 

**Why this matters and what could be the impact?**  
MATLAB as an incumbent- why can we disrupt them? They are a fantastic platform, but they are married to their programming language (MATLAB).


**Tasks today:**  
- This essay, roughly outlining the key design decisions & core technical challenge as we sprint through the next month. 
- Set up the SciCode Github and examine the problems. 
- Write an essay that justifies our existence. 
- Compulsory books for our company

(Note: it will be worth doing a much deeper dive into the repo- including the problems and sub-problems.)

**Random:**  
Thoughts about outputting in this way: https://www.mathworks.com/help/simbio/ug/simulating-the-glucose-insulin-response.html

Not just raw code


**Future work:**  
- Dealing with main-problem & sub-problem dependencies; work related to Rasched's hypothesis-testing graph. 


Update:  
My latest idea is for us to constrain very specifically to Biophysics. And I have a crazy idea. If we can get all the internal code for papers that are already published and hence not secret in Rasched's lab, then we have a way of tackling this problem from one niche!

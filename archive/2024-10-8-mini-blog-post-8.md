Woke up at 10am- I struggled to fall asleep last night because I'd gotten up very late that morning. No matter, I will adjust tonight- planning to sleep at 10pm, and wake up at 5.30am. 

So I was given a CodeSignal exam due Oct 14- 6 days from now. So, in that time, I have to train in Python. My plan is simple- I'll just continuously solve CodeSignal problems & switch to Leetcode when necessary. 

I of course have other duties- I need to find a place to stay and so on, but this comes later. 

Ok, so spent the day doing Leetcode stuff. Honestly, it feels like it will take a lot of iteration and work to get to a decent place with these kind of coding exams. 

I ran again- second day in a row, loving it!

I rescheduled with the Hightons. My short term plan is to stay with them until the end of the week, I did also apply to the Residency but I doubt I will hear back in time. I'll begin looking for places on Spareroom today onwards.

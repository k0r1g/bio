Rasched and I are exploring ideas for a new research lab- were constraining our exploration to the intersection of AI and science. 

For now, we've narrowed our focus around two key areas: (1) using AI for physics-based simulations, and (2) using AI to automatically replicate scientific experiments- starting with replicating scientific code. 


Write a post on hard ideas (spacex, tesla, northwood, rainmaker)

Write a post hardware inputs, and software outputs (aws, openai, gmaps)

world models and learning physics: https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1758355737066299692?t=n_FeaQVxXn4RJ0pqiW7Wfw&s=19
- how does the sort of physics simulator found in vision models like Sora (or 3d models like wordl labs) relate to the sort of physics we are thinking about in complex systems? is there a way they can be merged?


What about fully mapping hte world


**Code Generation for Convex Optimisation:**
"I think there is a good chance that normalizing flow-based variational inference will displace MCMC as the go-to method for Bayesian posterior inference as soon as everyone gets access to good GPUs." (full article [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/10/08/defining-statistical-models-in-jax/))

Basically, what this is arguing, is that for solving certain types of convex optimisaiton tasks, normalising flow models (which are a type of neural network) can outperform MCMC (which is a type of sampling algorithm) in speed and reliability. 

What's held it back is access to GPU and I think assuming that GPU-access is going to proliferate is an incredibly low-risk bet to take. This means that

Solvers like CVXGEN: Code Generation for Convex Optimization are incredibly quick and are said to be used in SpaceX rockets.

**SciCode Bench:**








Imagine google maps- except you can see video. You can hear sounds. Real-time. 


Conception (making babies)

What if we can make a google maps but with video and audio, and real-time. 


Computing: 

**Haxion**: Produces synthetic data for national security applications
- "AI-powered synthetic data on-demand. Quickly build, scale, and deliver high fidelity physical AI models in minutes."
*Notes: Interesting verticalisation of physics-based simulations*

**Navier AI**: Builds much faster simulations using a physics-ML solver
- Upload a CAD model, run CFD simulations '1000x faster', review results on a web-interface, & you can validate with traditional numerical sovler
- Seems like Navier AIâ€™s models can be fine-tuned with data from CFD simulations run with physics solvers
*Notes: YC startup, focussing on CFD.*

**Symbolica AI**: Alternative-architecture foundational models for structure reasoning

"Do we live in a simulation?" Lets build the simulation. Is that world labs?

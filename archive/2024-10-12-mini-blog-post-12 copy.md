**A quick reflection:**
I thank god that nobody is reading this. The last few days of blogging have been reflective of my productivity- poor and undisciplined. Here's how I will fix things: 
- *On blogging:* Go back to time-boxing 15 minutes of blogging. Just follow the stream of consciousness- it's that simple. Another tip is to focus on one key idea for a blog post. If you have stray ideas that you feel compelled to jot down, write them under a sub-header, but always have a single idea that is the 'prevailing wind' of your blog. 
- *On work:* at the end of every blog, divide your day into three chunks- every day will contain three deliverables that you will have defined for that day. Do not go into the minutae, that will be sorted out in situ. 
- *On my challenges:* I haven't been doing my Anki- I'll make a rule to do it straight after blogging. I also haven't been coding as much, this will be solved by the work-chunks defined above. However, I have been running a lot- so kudos for that. 

**Cursor Founders- bravo:**
The Cursor podcast with Lex Fridman is fantastic- those founders are exceptional, and they serve as inspiration for how much I need to improve. I shall take it as a reminder about how incredibly important it is to focus on self-improvement and learning- I will get there if I am active about constantly imrpoving. In practice, this means coding more, reading more papers, taking notes, practicing my Anki, and being having a student's mindset. 

More on these founders: besides being incredibly technical, they come across as deeply thoughtful about their product and thus opinionated about the future of programming.While the rest of industry is thinking about Replit-style agents to automate end-to-end software development, in other words, having the opinion that natural language is the final froniter of programming, the Cursor team believes that programming isn't going away because it enables far more control over features. Their version of autonomy contrasts from writing a single prompt and letting an agent code a full product and instead looks like an engineer click tab->tab->tab as Cursor's AI predicts low-entropy code that needs to be written, and allowing the engineer to interrupt and input with their own code when necessary. I buy that- or rather, I believe in a world that has both visions of the world, but I sort of feel like the Cursor appraoch is one that will lead to far more powerful applications. 

One big lesson is that all AI wrappers are not created equal- the amount of work the Cursor team has put into integrating different models into different parts of the UX to enable different experiences is incredible. For example, using caching to make models work quickly, different ideas around how to structure model outputs given the uncertainty in intent when a user inputs a poorly specificed prompt. Fantastic. 

There was just such nuance and thoughtfulness. So impressed and it reflects in my experience as a user- Cursor is my favourite AI product.

I mentioned this to Rasched, but I do find it notable that Cursor really only took off when Claude Sonnet 3.5 came out. It's Claude's underlying ability to code extremely well that really got Cursor to product-market fit, despite having existed for some time before that. It goes to show that as the underlying models improve, more capabilities will be enabled, and will open up more opportunities for applications built on top of them. Some products, like Cursor, benefit because the sheer amount of thoughtful engineering work done to integrate these models into different parts of the UX, while other wrappers will be obsoleted. 

**Work Today:**

Chunk 1: Idea spam. Tomorrow is truly the deadline for choosing an idea, and this determines the rest of the month and your YC application. Take this work seriously. Lets structure it in a way that enables you to generate many ideas. Here are some ways for you to consider: 
- Write down categories of ideas and beliefs- then generate ideas within each category. 
- Write down things that excite you, things that you want to build expertise in, and generate ideas in this category. 
- Write down ways that you can make money immediately, and generate ideas here. 
- It will also help to read content and get inspired, like Dario's blog poast on a post-AGI world. I'll start here but doing this like this always risks a certain passiveness and also veers towards consensus thinking. Perhaps because of this, we should end our session wit this work and not start with it. 
- I should also allocate a certain amount of time for this work, say 2 hours. 

Chunk 2: Coding. I wish to finish all CodeSignal questions on the GitHub today and I'll do so in quite a structured manner, specifically, I'll assign a fixed amount of time for each question, and I'll get Cursor to help me finish if I do not complete it in time. 

Chunk 3: Book accomodation. Actually I need to start with this.

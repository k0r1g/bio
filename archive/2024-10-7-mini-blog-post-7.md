**Part 1: Deciding on a Visa**

I've decided not to risk going with the ESTA to get in the US. Time to apply for the B1 visa.

Seems to be that the rule of thumb is that for every day you stay in the US on ESTA/B1, you should stay 1/2 days outside of the US, and ensure you have strong ties to the UK. It also appears that during the B1 interview, an I-94 is issued, and the interviewer decides how long you are allowed to stay in the US- the 6 months number is simply the upper limit, it could be 2 weeks or 2 months. 

I left the US on May 27. It is now October 7. So it's been roughly 133 days since I've been in the US- so 4.5 months, I'm in the range of possibly an acceptable amount of time outside of the US, but I'm (1) unemployed- although there are ways around this with my business in Singapore, (2) during my previous trip to the US, I stayed a full 3 months in SF. I do not want to risk losing my ability to come to the US, so I've decided in order to go there, I must pre-emptively have a 3 month schedule planned. Either I want a research programme or an accelerator, or something similar to justify my time there. 

My decision is final. 

*tl;dr* Do not go to the US until you have 3 months of work planned there. 

**Part 2: Planning my time up till a trip to the US**
A good default is to stay in the UK. I can begin to look at SpareRoom- book out till the end of the year. Worst case scenario is that I leave earlier because a great opportunity presents itself in the US, and at worst I lose some money on accomodation I will not need. 

**Part 3: Justifying my time in the US**
This work is less immediate, but I want to apply for accelerators like Founders Inc or Z Fellows to justify a 3 months stay. Explore fellowships. Explore grants. This will be its own blog post. 

**Part 4: Planning this Week**
Tues- book a place in SpareRoom. I may have to ask to stay in Bath or something in the meantime, or maybe Oxford. 

**Part 5: Projecting the next 3 months**
Key Dates: 
- November 12: YC Deadline for Jan-March 2025 cohort in SF. 

I will get a gym membership. I will run frequently. I will take supplements. I will live a full and healthy existence, but fully in monk mode- building, making money, studying, and applying to opportunities.

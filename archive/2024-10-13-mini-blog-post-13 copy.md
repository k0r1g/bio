Today's main topic will be about choosing the right idea. Basically, with Cursor and other code-gen tools, getting to an MVP is so easy that YC is going to be flooded with MVPs built by 15 year olds. 

First, this means that if you don't have an MVP, you're already behind. Second, this means that you need to have de-risked some key technical challenge **or** have non-negligible traction **or** be niche/expert in some obviously interesting way. 

We have chosen to focus on de-risking some key technical challenge. 

**Coding**
Code Signal prep went out the window over the last few days in favour of idea generation- which is frankly just such a fuzzy and time-wastey process. 

**Anki**
Anki was kind of tricky today, and I realised my questions require too long an answer. I will have to refactor them.

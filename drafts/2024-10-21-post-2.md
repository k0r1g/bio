AI Scientist
- swe performance was at 18% dont be daunted by the 5% performance on sci code 
- they use aider for code- not just baseline model (look into why, maybe its an agent framework)
- since they focus on ml research, they are able to give a model a code template (specifically on ai training) for the model to start from 

wow! sakana ai paper has many interesting ideas:
* they give their ai scientist a code template (which contains plotting code, code on research topic, and some styling info) for the model to riff on: https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist/tree/main/templates
 
 
 key tools that they use: 
 - AIDER 
 - Semantic Scholar API (Fricke, 2018) and web access as a tool (Schick et al., 2024). In particular they use Semantic Scholar API to access the web to do references
 - Code compilation allows us to check if the code runs. We need some sort of 'scientific compiler' to make sure our code makes scientific sense. 
    - one idea is to perhaps using wolfram as a compiler?
 
 
 One big difference is: sakana ai is building an agent, and we dont. we just want single output code gen. 
 
 
 previous AI-enabled systems such as FunSearch (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024) and GNoME (Pyzer- Knapp et al., 2022) also conduct impressive scientific discovery in restricted domains, but they do not write papers.

 
 key concepts that they rely on:

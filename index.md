# About me 
I'm Kori and I really care about advancing science. 

My Mum is from Okinawa and my Dad is from the UK. I owe everything to my parents! I have a funny accent (American-ish, Singaporean twist, maybe a sprinkle of English) because I was born in HK, spent the first few years of my life in Japan, then Korea untill I was 10, before moving to Singapore till I left for the UK for university. Singapore is what I consider home, it's where my childhood friends live, and I have a deep respect for the country and a lot of my values are shaped from growing up there. 

I completed a BA & MEng in Engineering Science at Oxford University with a focus on Clinical AI, where I was supervised by Prof. David Clifton, and built models that enable clinical alarms to predict if patients would be admitted to ICUs before a medical emergency occurs.

Straight after university, I co-founded a company that raised $8.3M and sent a human to space via Blue Origin. After that, I worked on a string of projects including some time as a Founder-in-Residence at Entrepreneur First.

<!-- # Blog posts I will wirte
- ClickSolve AI
- Once I move to SF, I wish to write a blog post about the multi-year journey it took me to get there. 
- BIG POST: Building a startup in a post-AGI world. 
- LessWrong POST: Write a post about interpretability for chain-of-thought models
- Write a post about SONAR models (which I believe is how Perplexity does their autocomplete) and how Cursor likely does auto-complete and their tab feature. Could also look at open-source versions like Continue to figure this out.  -->
